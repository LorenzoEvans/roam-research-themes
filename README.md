# Minimal Roam Research themes
This project brings typography that's more to my taste for Roam Research. It's easily installable via the Stylus Chrome plugin.

**Features:**
* Uses Roboto Google font
* Bright color scheme to add visual interest to the UX (monochrome version also available)

Disclaimer: 
This might break some features because I don't use everything Roam has to offer and so didn't test everything
