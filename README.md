# Minimal Roam Research themes
This project brings typography that's more to my taste for Roam Research. It's easily installable via the Stylus Chrome plugin.

**Features:**
* Uses Roboto Google font
* Bright color scheme to add visual interest to the UX (monochrome version also available)

# Installation instructions
Download the CSS version you prefer to your machine, open the code, and copy and paste into the Stylus Chrome extension. Type in the ``http://roamresearch.com`` URL into the box at the top to activate in your instance.

For more detailed instructions, see the [Bear theme's readme](https://github.com/apg-dev/roam-theme-bear/blob/master/README.md)

## Disclaimers/credits
This might break some features because I don't use everything Roam has to offer and so didn't test everything.

I used some of the code from other themes, including the aforementioned [Bear theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/f0h3ha/bearlike_css_for_roam_chrome/)
